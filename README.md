Quack: A Parodical Text Adventure Game

I developed Quack as the final project for Southern New Hampshire University's (SNHU) IT-140 intro to programming course.

Beyond the core requirements, I implemented classes, a tkinter GUI (which required refactoring all input/output of the original CLI-driven program), external JSON importing, external JSON saving and some other added functionality to the "gameplay."
